twinkly-pendant
===============

Twinkly pendant or earring, about 25mm diameter PCB with MSP430G2231 14TSSOP, 8x 0805 LEDs, and LiR2032.

The intention is to use near-visible UV LEDs (~395nm). Central area for mounting uranium glass button.

To protect against accidental discharge, unclip from metal chain and/or findings when not in use and 
store in ESD safe packaging.

Versions
